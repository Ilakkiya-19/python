enter a string:sky is blue
eulb si yks


logic:
For the input string "sky is blue":

When processing "sky", word becomes "yks" (reversed).
On encountering the space after "sky", "yks " is added to reversed_string.
Reset word to an empty string and start reversing the next word "is".
Continue this process until the entire string is processed.

Loop Through Characters: This loop iterates over each character in the input string s.
Check for Non-Space Characters:
If char is not a space, it adds char to the beginning of word, effectively reversing the order of characters as they are encountered.
Space Handling:
When a space is encountered, it means the end of a word has been reached:
Append Reversed Word: The reversed word (built so far) is added to reversed_string, followed by a space to preserve the original spacing.
Reset word: The word variable is reset to an empty string to start building the next word.
